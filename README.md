# What is this?
TimeReport is a sample I created when trying to build a 'best practice' .NET Core web API. I didn't come very far and the solution has some flaws but it still shows a pretty decent onion architecture and also follows some important design patterns and principles.

The app is an embryo of what was going to be the backend api for some kind of time tracking / timesheet system.
